**Context.** Project started after reading about an independent researcher's AI-assisted
candidate around TIC 4206066 (3.18 day, about 500 ppm, Zenodo preprint, not confirmed).
Decision: build a general injection-recovery benchmark rather than chase one result.

**Environment.** Linux, Python 3.13.9 via uv venv, RTX 4050 6 GB, 12 cores, 15 GB RAM.
MAST and PyPI reachable.

**Setup.**
- `git init`, `pyproject.toml` with dependencies, no lock file (owner's request).
- `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`. batman 2.5.1 needs `distutils`, which Python 3.13 removed,
  so `setuptools` was added as a runtime dependency. Verified imports:
  lightkurve 2.6.0, batman 2.5.1, astropy 8.0.1, numpy 2.5.4.
